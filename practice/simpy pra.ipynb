    "This case study uses a simple model of an urgent care telephone call centre, similar to the NHS 111 service in the UK. To learn simpy we will first build a very simple model. In our first iteration of this model, calls to the centre arrive deterministically. For now we will ignore resources and activities in the model and just model a deterministic arrival process. The simulation time units are in minutes. Let's assume there are 60 new callers per hour (an fixed inter-arrival time of 1.0 per minute)."
